				<p>			The Devgad Mango is a variety of mango native to the Devgad taluka of Maharashtra, India. 
                    It is known for its sweet and juicy flesh, smooth and thin skin, and long shelf life.
                    The Devgad Mango has been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, 
                    which means that only mangoes grown in the Devgad taluka can be labelled as Devgad mangoes.
                    The season typically lasts from February to mid-June. The mangoes are harvested when fully ripe
                     and have developed their characteristic yellow colour. The mangoes are then carefully packed
                      and shipped to markets all over India and worldwide.
                    They are a popular choice for eating fresh and for use in juices, jams, and pickles.
                     They are also popular in traditional Indian sweets, such as aam lassi and aamras.Devgad, the heartland of Alphonso mango,
					  is now home to one of the most advanced and largest mango processing factory in the Konkan region of Maharashtra. 
					  Devgad Taluka Amba Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha Ltd has started one of the biggest fruit/food processing plant in the Konkan region.
					  Mango Bonds is a bond scheme from Devgad Taluka Amba Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit, in which you pay for the mangoes
					   in advance and in return we offer you rate protection or discount over the market rate. We had launched the first version of Mango Bonds in 2011.
					   Devgad is a coastal town in Sindhudurg District of Maharashtra, in western India. It is a natural harbour Arabian Sea in the Konkan region of Maharashtra, 
					   located off NH 17, 200 km from Goa and 500 km from Mumbai. It is loved by tourists for its clean, sparkling beaches and the fort Vijaydurg,
					    the place where Helium was discovered. The historical Kunkeshwar Temple is also an attraction in Devgad as it attracts a large number of devotees round the year.
					   It is the Hapus or Alphonso mango that brings world fame for Devgad. The mango cultivar grown in Devgad is best among all
					    mango because of its unique flavour, taste, shape, colour and sweetness. Because of its fan following, many other varieties
						 are sold in the market as Devgad Hapus. The Devgad variety can be identified by its saffron-yellow colour and thin skin.
						  It has no fibre content, and unlike other mangoes, it can be peeled like a banana, without pulling out the kernel.</p>

				<h4 align="center"><li> Sindhudurg Fort </li></h4>
			<img src="sindhudurg-fort-sunny-nikam.jpg"height="300"width="400"align="left"border="5px">
				<p>			Sindhudurg Fort is a historical sea fort located in Arabian Sea near the Konkan region of Maharashtra
                     in Western India.The fort, commissioned by Chhatrapati Shivaji, was constructed between 1664 and 1667. 
                     The fort lies off the shore of Malvan taluka of the Sindhudurg District in the Konkan region of Maharashtra, 
                     450 kilometres (280 mi) south of Mumbai. It is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India.
					 Sindhudurg island-fort was built under Shivaji I, the founder of the Maratha Empire. The fort's foundation 
					 stone was laid on 25 November 1664. Construction was supervised by Hiroji Indulkar who was took assistance
					  from Portuguese engineers of Goa. The fort's main objective was to counter the rising influence of English,
					   Dutch, French and Portuguese merchants in the Konkan coast, and to curb the rise of Siddhis of Janjira.
					    The fort was built on a small island known as the Khurte island.
					
						Shivaji I had brought 200 Vaddera people to build this fort. Over 4,000 pounds of lead were used in the
						 casting and foundation stones were firmly laid down. Construction started on 25 November 1664.
						  Built over a period of three years (1664-1667), the sea fort is spread over 48 acres,
						   with a two-mile (3 km) long rampart, and walls that are 30 feet (9.1 m) high and 12 feet (3.7 m) thick.
						    The massive walls were designed to serve as a deterrent to approaching enemies and to the waves and 
							tides of the Arabian Sea. The main entrance is concealed in such a way that no one can pinpoint it from outside.
							[citation needed]

						The number of permanent residents living in the fort has been in decline since its abandonment. 
						Most residents have moved out due to inadequate employment opportunities but some families remain. 
						The fort is closed for tourists during rainy season due to high tides.
						Sindhudurg Fort, meaning “Fort in the Sea,” was commissioned by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1664.
						 This historic endeavor aimed to bolster maritime defenses along the Konkan coast. The fort was strategically 
						 constructed on the island of Kurte, near the Malvan town. Over the centuries, it played a pivotal role in
						  various maritime battles and has remained a symbol of the Maratha naval power.</p>

				<h4 align="center"><li>Fugdi</li></h4>
			<img src="DSC02262.JPG"height="300"width="400"align="left"border="5px">
				<p>			Fugdi is a folk dance performed by the womenfolk of some communities of Konkanies in the Konkan coastal region
                     of kokan and Maharashtra states during the Hindu religious festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi and Vrata or towards 
                     the end of other dances like Dhalo. According to certain historical facts, this dance style is said to have been 
                     created from few ancient Goan traditions. In addition, this dance is mainly performed during the Hindu month of Bhadrapada,
                      when women usually take a break to escape boredom arising from their daily routines.
                       Furthermore, it is also performed during religious and social events.
					   Fugdi is an art form that can be traced to the primeval cultural traditions of Maharashtra and Goa. 
					   It is performed during various religious and social occasions. Fugdi is generally performed during the month of Bhaadrapada,
					    an occasion for the women to take a temporary break from their normal, monotonous schedule.
						 A distinctive style of fugdi is found among the dhangar (shepherd community) women. The kalashi fugdi is performed 
						 before goddess Mahalaxkshmi during the vrata offered to that goddess.
						 The women sing and dance while enacting varied formations - in a circle or in rows. Usually women in the villages dance Fugdi 
						 in circles and women in forest settlements formulate rows.[2] The dance starts with invocation to Hindu Gods.
						  The pace is slow in the beginning, but soon attains a fast pace, reaching climax. No percussion support is provided.
						   At the maximum pace, the dancers match the rhythm by blowing air through the mouth that sounds like "FOO".
						    Hence the name Foogdi or Fugdi. A few fixed steps and hand gestures and hand laps are the major elements.
						  No instrument or musical accompaniment is found with the dance, but special fugdi songs are innumerable.
						  Girki, Cycle, Rahat, Zimma, Karvar, Bus Fugdi, Kombda, Ghuma, and Pakhwa are among the popular sub-forms.
						   Kalashi Fugdi began as a means to break the monotony of the routine of fetching water from long distances.
						    The women would dance their way out to the water-holes while blowing into the empty pitchers.
						   Katti Fugdi is another popular form, performed with coconut shells in their hands.</p>

				<h4 align="center"><li>Farming</li></h4>
			<img src="farming-in-konkan.jpg"height="300"width="400"align="left"border="5px">
				<p>		 Farming started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.
					 The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution as people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in cities.

					Farming and domestication probably started in the Fertile Crescent (the Nile Valley, the Levant and Mesopotamia).
					 The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt.
					  Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew.
					
					Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 4200 BC.
					
					Livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats were taken to the Americas, from the Old World. 
					The first of those horses, came with the Spanish conquistadors(or soldiers and explorers) in the 1490s.
					 Moving those cattle, sheep, goats and horses, were part of the Columbian Exchange.
					
					People probably started agriculture by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild.
					 People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. 
					 Farming can feed many more people than hunter-gatherers can feed on the same amount of land.
					
					This allowed the human population to grow to such large numbers as there are today.
					Devgad, located offshore Arabian Sea, comprises 70 villages, whose major breadwinner is the Alphonso mango trade.
                      Alphonso is grown on 45,000 acres in Devgad and reaches 50,000 tonnes in a year of decent production.
                       This year the farmers are staring at a lean period in production and
                     the taluka is scheduled to reach about 30 percent of its normal production.
					 Devgad is also widely known for its pure Alphonso mango cultivation/farming and the whole development has 
					 evolved due to undertaking of the cultivation of Alphonso mango farming.[5] Mangoes grown here are characterized 
					 by their distinct aroma, smooth exterior, thin skin and thick saffron pulp. The variety is different from the
					  Alphonso mangoes grown in the Ratnagiri district. Such is the popularity of the Devgad Alphonso mango that vendors
					   often pass off other similar looking mangoes under the name of Devgad Alphonso. Devgad Alphonso mango is grown 
					   on an area of 45,000 acres and reaches a production of about 50,000 tons in a year of decent production.
					    Devgad is also home to the oldest and biggest co-operative society of mango farmers in India, called the Devgad Taluka
						 Amba Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit or Devgad Taluka Mango Growers Society Ltd with over 700 alphonso growers and 25-year-old in 2013.

					 Fishing is carried out on a large scale in the sea as well as in the creeks throughout the taluka region. 
					 The staple diet of this region is rice and fish.

				<h4 align="center"><li>Vagh baras</li></h4>
			<img src="vagh baras.jpg"height="300"width="400"align="left"border="5px">
				<p>			Vagh Baras is a religious Hindu festival that marks the commencement of Diwali festivities. 
                    It is an auspicious thanksgiving day dedicated to cows for their help in sustaining the human race.
                     Devotees believe that observance of the day helps in fulfilling all their wishes.
					 They comply with rituals mentioned in the Bhavishya Purana that emphasises the importance and holiness
					  of the Cow in Hinduism. The festival is known as Vasu Baras in the state of Maharashtra. In Gujarat, 
					  it is observed as Vagh Baras or Aso Vad Baras and as Sripada Vallabha Aradhana Utsav in the southern
					   state of Andhra Pradesh. In some parts of India, the festival is called Bach Baras while northern states
					    celebrate the day as Govatsa Dwadashi. The followers of Shaivism, a sect within Hinduism that reveres Shiva as its supreme being, 
						celebrate the day as Nandini Vrat, as both Nandini (Divine Cow) and Nandi ( Sacred Bull) are considered holy.The word ‘Vagh’ implies
						 the repayment of financial debts while ‘Baras’ refers to the financial year. Thus, businessmen clear their accounts on this day 
						 and make no further entries in new ledgers until the day of Labh Pancham.
					 The Holy scriptures relate to a legend that mentions the importance of Vagh Baras. It is believed that at the time of Samudra Manthan
					  or Churning of the Sea, five wish-fulfilling cows or Kamdhenus emerged. Among them appeared a Divine cow named Nanda. The day gained
					   religious importance of worshipping the sacred cow Nanda and gradually came to be celebrated as Vagh Baras.
					   The Vagh Baras celebration honours Nandini, a holy cow revered in Hinduism as a source of food for all life on Earth. 
					   Nandini is revered by Hindus as the sacred cow who bestows milk and prosperity. On Vagh Baras, devotees follow a day-long fast, 
					   abstaining from dairy items such as milk and curd, as well as items prepared from wheat.
					   Vagh Baras also hold a lot of significance for childless couples who can worship Nandini, the holy cow, and keep a fast. 
					   Women follow a fast for the prosperity and growth of their offspring. To honour cows, ‘anaaj’ and sprouting moong daal are served.
					    Married women perform a puja for their family’s health, which is known as
					    ‘Gau Pujan.’ Everyone celebrates the festival with zeal for their family’s success and growth.</p>

				<h4 align="center"><li>Dasha Avtar</li></h4>
			<img src="maxresdefault (2).jpg"height="300"width="400"align="left"border="5px">
				<p>			The Dashavatara (Sanskrit: दशावतार, daśāvatāra) are the ten primary avatars of Vishnu, a principal Hindu god.
                     Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore cosmic order.The word Dashavatara derives from
                      daśa, meaning "ten", and avatāra, roughly equivalent to "incarnation".
					  The list of included avatars varies across sects and regions, particularly in respect to the inclusion of Balarama
					   (brother of Krishna) or Gautama Buddha. Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard,
					    the "most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is [...] Krishna, Buddha."
						 Most draw from the following set of figures, in this order:Matsya; Kurma; Varaha; Narasimha; Vamana; Parashurama; 
						 Rama; Krishna or Balarama; Buddha[note 1] or Krishna; and Kalki. In traditions that omit Krishna, he often replaces
						  Vishnu as the source of all avatars. Some traditions include a regional deity such as Vithoba[10] or Jagannath
						   in penultimate position, replacing Krishna or Buddha. All avatars have appeared except one; Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.

					  The order of the ancient concept of Dashavataras has also been interpreted to be reflective of modern Darwinian evolution,
					   as a description of the evolution of consciousness.
					   According to Swami Parmeshwaranand, although the avatars of Vishnu are countless in number and include hermits, Manus,
					    sons of Manus, and other Devas (gods), due to the curse of a Rishi called Bhrigu most are only partial (i.e. incomplete) incarnations. 
						The Dashavatara is a list of the ten complete (i.e. full) incarnations.
						Various versions of the list of Vishnu's avatars exist, varying per region and tradition.
						 Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar,
						  while others, such as the Paripāṭal[citation needed] (c. 3rd-4th CE), 
						  which is the fifth of the Eight Anthologies (Ettuthokai) in the Sangam literature, and the Yatindramatadipika, 
						  a 17th-century summary of Sri Vaishnava doctrine, give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth.
						   The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who do not accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu.
						    One list in the Mahabharata gives Rama (Bhargava), Rama (Dasharathi), Satvata (Krishna or Balarama),
							 the Tri-Rama. The Tantric Prapanchasara (attributed to Adi Shankara, but disputed,[16]) also omits the Buddha.
							  Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard,
						 the "most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is [...] Krishna, Buddha</p>

				<h4 align="center"><li>Kunkeshwar Temple</li></h4>
			<img src="kunkeshwar.jpg"height="300"width="400"align="left"border="5px">
				<p>		Kunkeshwar (ISO15919: Kuṇakēśvar) is a village in Maharashtra, India situated on the bank of Arabian Sea.
                     There is a temple for the Hindu deity Shiva in the village. Situated along the sea in the Sindhudurg district,
                     Kunkeshwar is known for its shore-side Shiva temple and the adjacent beach. The region is known for its year-round
                     supply of Alphonso mangoes. Kunkeshwar is 16 kilometers away from Devgarh(devgad), 54 kilometers
                      from Malvan and 60 kilometers from Kankavli.
					  The history of the village of Kunkeshwar can be traced back to several hundred years ago. It is believed that a Muslim sailor was travelling in the sea for trade when he was caught in a storm. As he dreaded dying, he spotted a lamp on a beach closest to him that was the Kunkeshwar Beach. He prayed to the lamp that whoever it is that it was or whoever owned that lamp, if that could help him land in peace, he will build a temple for it.
						Fortunately enough, he was saved from the storm and landed safe on the shore. Once he got off safe, he did get a temple built at the spot he spotted the lamp. Also, the lingam of God Shiva was already there at the spot. But later, he was scared that he will not be accepted in his community as he built a temple for the Hindus. So 
						he jumped and committed suicide from the rooftop of the temple soon after.
					  Kunkeshwar is a village on the bank of the Arabian Sea. The village is known for Kunkeshwar Temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva.
					   Kunkeshwar is also famous for producing Alphonso mangoes.

					  Known to be a perfectly peaceful and tranquil place, the highlight of the hamlet is the revered Shiva temple.
					   Besides, the chiming of the temple bells along with the crashing of waves on the golden sunlit shores makes the place even
					    more enticing, even more meditative. People visit here mostly 
					  to pay respect to the gods but other than that, you can also find tourists.
					  Mahashivratrii is the grandest event celebrated in the village of Kunkeshwar as it is believed to be the day of Lord Shiva. Several devotees and pilgrims gather here with the locals to prepare for the annual event. The lanes are decorated with lights and diyas, and a feast is arranged. The celebrations go on for a total of three days.</p>

				<p>			Konkani food is primarily non-vegetarian, but it does contain some vegetarian and milder-flavoured Konkanastha brahmin cooking.
                Typically, two preparation methods Karwar and Malvani are used. Coconut and kokam, which are staple commodities in every Konkan
                 household, are frequently thought of as being absent from traditional Konkani cuisine.

				 Sol kadhi is a gently spicy beverage made with kokum and coconut milk that is among the most well-known beverages to come out of the Konkan region. Since it is regarded as a digestive, a glass is usually sipped following a meal. If you walk throughout the Konkan shore, you may encounter many variants. It occasionally may contain cumin, garlic, and coriander leaves. This watery variation has chopped cumin and coriander in kokum-infused water (like an infusion). If you were contemplating, kokum is a natural item in the mangosteen family.
				 A common dish served in Konkan regions, such as Maharashtra, is bombil fry, also known as Bombay Duck. This is a side dish that many restaurants and pubs in Mumbai serve to go with your beverages. Bombay duck is a type of fish that can be eaten fresh or dried and should not be confused with any bird species. It is fried after being mixed with spices, occasionally with rava on top, and served with lemon wedges.A Konkani-style Tindora stir-fry is known as Konkani Tendli Sukke. With the addition of jaggery for sweetness and tamarind for a hint of tartness, the dish is spiced with a freshly ground masala of coconut and red chilies.
				
				
				 Pathrode is another name for Alu Vadi. Colocasia leaves are used to roll the packed patra. Its Hindi name is “Arbi ke patte.” Alu or aloo is the Marathi word for colocasia leaves. When prepared with the proper seasonings, it tastes delicious to eat. In order to remove all of those qualities from the leaf, it is also a tongue-itchy that must be steeped in tamarind water for an entire night. In hotels and houses alike, this vadi is served as a snack. When attendees arrive at events, they are served.

				 When these packed rice dumplings are warm, they taste like pure heaven. The sticky mixture of coconut and dry fruit only needs a generous amount of ghee to be ready.
