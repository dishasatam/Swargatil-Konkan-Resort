				<p>			This is one of the most commercially active beaches in the Konkan.
                     It is buzzing with life at the jetty where most of the fishermen anchor 
                     their boats of various dimensions and colors. There are a few bars and restaurants
                      on the beach unlike most other seashores on the Sindhudurg coast.

                    This beach is not a place for relaxation, however, it is close to the city centre
                     and perhaps the most accessible beach in the area. Another promising forthcoming
                      attraction here is a one of its kind marine park in Asia. The government has proposed
                       the marine park since 2000, but there has not been any action on it yet.
                        The area of Malvan is a fortified island on the coastal reef.
